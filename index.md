## Brief Bio

I am currently a graduate student at Department of Computer Science in Stony Brook Univeristy. From fall 2018 I'm working in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/) under the supervision of Prof. Dimitris Samaras, Prof. Minh Hoai and Prof. Gregory Zelinsky
Prior to this, I received my master degree from the Robotics Institute, Carnege Mellon University in 2013 advised by Prof. Mel Siegel.
I work on research problems in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in plugging human visual perception experience into computer vision to either boost performance or enable human-like results. I am also interested in the other way around -- using computer vision algorithms to model human visual perception systems.
