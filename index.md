## Brief Bio

I am currently a PhD candidate at Department of Computer Science in Stony Brook Univeristy. From fall 2018 I'm working in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitris Samaras](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/).

In Summer and Fall 2025, I interned as an **Applied Scientist in Amazon**. Where I applied reinforcement learning and Chain-of-Thought to train a multimodal agent (MLLM) to use a set of tools (foundational models) to find visual defects in customer uploaded images. We improved the classification performance by **6.1%**. 


Prior to this, I received my master degree from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India in 2016 advised by [Prof. Sudeep K S](http://people.cse.nitc.ac.in/sudeep/).

**Research Interest:** I work on research problems in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in the field of using Unsupervised techniques for performing object detection and Fine Grained Classification.

**Industry Experience:** I have worked as Senior Software Developer in Cisco for 2 years and prior to that I have almost two years experience in Wipro Technologies as a Project Engineer.
