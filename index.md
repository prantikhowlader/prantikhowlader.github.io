I am currently a PhD candidate at Department of Computer Science in Stony Brook Univeristy. From fall 2018 I'm working in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitris Samaras](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/), [Prof. Minh Hoai](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~minhhoai/) and [Prof. Joel Saltz](https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/people/joel_saltz).


Prior to this, I received my master degree from National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India in 2016 advised by [Prof. Sudeep K S](http://people.cse.nitc.ac.in/sudeep/).

**Research Interest:** I work on research problems in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in the field of using Unsupervised techniques for performing object detection and Fine Grained Classification.

**Industry Experience:** I have worked as Senior Software Developer in Cisco for 2 years and prior to that I have almost two years experience in Wipro Technologies as a Project Engineer.
